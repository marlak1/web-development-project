# web-development-project



Brief


Your task is to build an interactive website using web technologies. Your project should make use of the range of techniques you have explored during the module and demonstrate your understanding of these techniques and ability to deploy them successfully. For this assessment you have to decide a theme on which you will create your website.

Theme 1 â€“ Portfolio
In this theme, you can create your own personal portfolio website that showcases your work, experience and overall development, something that you can use professionally in future.

Constraints
       

For the above themes there are some creative/technical constraints to consider:

The piece must deploy HTML5 and CSS.
The website must include at least 3 pages in which the user must be able to make navigational decisions (e.g. pick where they want to go next).
Your website should include media assets (i.e. still images, moving
images, (audio or video if possible)) to make your website more interactive and engaging.
Javascript and related languages/technologies may be used to enhance your website.
